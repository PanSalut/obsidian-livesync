# Self-hosted LiveSync - Coolify Deployment Version
[Japanese docs](./README_ja.md) - [Chinese docs](./README_cn.md).

> **🚀 Coolify Deployment Ready**  
> This repository has been prepared for easy deployment on [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) self-hosting platform with pre-configured Docker setup and CORS settings optimized for Obsidian LiveSync.


Self-hosted LiveSync is a community-developed synchronisation plug-in available on all Obsidian-compatible platforms. It leverages robust server solutions such as CouchDB or object storage systems (e.g., MinIO, S3, R2, etc.) to ensure reliable data synchronisation.

Additionally, it supports peer-to-peer synchronisation using WebRTC now (experimental), enabling you to synchronise your notes directly between devices without relying on a server.

![obsidian_live_sync_demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45774780/137355323-f57a8b09-abf2-4501-836c-8cb7d2ff24a3.gif)

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This plug-in is not compatible with the official "Obsidian Sync" and cannot synchronise with it.

## Features
- Synchronise vaults efficiently with minimal traffic.
- Handle conflicting modifications effectively.
  - Automatically merge simple conflicts.
- Use open-source solutions for the server.
  - Compatible solutions are supported.
- Support end-to-end encryption.
- Synchronise settings, snippets, themes, and plug-ins via [Customisation Sync (Beta)](#customization-sync) or [Hidden File Sync](#hiddenfilesync).
- Enable WebRTC peer-to-peer synchronisation without requiring a `host` (Experimental).
  - This feature is still in the experimental stage. Please exercise caution when using it.
  - WebRTC is a peer-to-peer synchronisation method, so **at least one device must be online to synchronise**.
  - Instead of keeping your device online as a stable peer, you can use two pseudo-peers:
    - [livesync-serverpeer](https://github.com/vrtmrz/livesync-serverpeer): A pseudo-client running on the server for receiving and sending data between devices.
    - [webpeer](https://github.com/vrtmrz/livesync-commonlib/tree/main/apps/webpeer): A pseudo-client for receiving and sending data between devices.
    - A pre-built instance is available at [fancy-syncing.vrtmrz.net/webpeer](https://fancy-syncing.vrtmrz.net/webpeer/) (hosted on the vrtmrz blog site). This is also peer-to-peer. Feel free to use it.
  - For more information, refer to the [English explanatory article](https://fancy-syncing.vrtmrz.net/blog/0034-p2p-sync-en.html) or the [Japanese explanatory article](https://fancy-syncing.vrtmrz.net/blog/0034-p2p-sync).

This plug-in may be particularly useful for researchers, engineers, and developers who need to keep their notes fully self-hosted for security reasons. It is also suitable for anyone seeking the peace of mind that comes with knowing their notes remain entirely private.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> - Before installing or upgrading this plug-in, please back up your vault.
> - Do not enable this plug-in alongside another synchronisation solution at the same time (including iCloud and Obsidian Sync).
> - For backups, we also provide a plug-in called [Differential ZIP Backup](https://github.com/vrtmrz/diffzip).

## How to use

### 🚀 Quick Setup - Deploy on Coolify

**Recommended for Coolify users**

1. **Deploy on Coolify:**
   - Import this repository to your GitHub account
   - Create a new project in Coolify and connect your GitHub repository
   - Coolify will automatically detect the `docker-compose.yml` and deploy CouchDB
   - Set environment variables: `COUCHDB_USER` and `COUCHDB_PASSWORD`
   - Deploy and access your CouchDB at `https://your-domain.com:5984`

2. **Configure Obsidian Plugin:**
   - Install "Self-hosted LiveSync" plugin in Obsidian
   - Use your Coolify deployment URL as the remote database
   - Follow the [Quick Setup](docs/quick_setup.md) guide for plugin configuration

### 3-minute setup - CouchDB on fly.io

**Alternative deployment option**

[![LiveSync Setup onto Fly.io SpeedRun 2024 using Google Colab](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7sa_I1832Xc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sa_I1832Xc)

1. [Setup CouchDB on fly.io](docs/setup_flyio.md)
2. Configure plug-in in [Quick Setup](docs/quick_setup.md)

### Manually Setup

1. Setup the server
   1. [Setup CouchDB on fly.io](docs/setup_flyio.md)
   2. [Setup your CouchDB](docs/setup_own_server.md)
2. Configure plug-in in [Quick Setup](docs/quick_setup.md)
> [!TIP]
> Fly.io is no longer free. Fortunately, despite some issues, we can still use IBM Cloudant. Refer to [Setup IBM Cloudant](docs/setup_cloudant.md).
> And also, we can use peer-to-peer synchronisation without a server. Or very cheap Object Storage -- Cloudflare R2 can be used for free.
> HOWEVER, most importantly, we can use the server that we trust. Therefore, please set up your own server.
> CouchDB can be run on a Raspberry Pi. (But please be careful about the security of your server).
